# QUAD

## QUAD is a productivity app written in Java that takes the methodology behind Stephen R. Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective People' and allows the user to organise their day/week in a small, lightweight app.

## Aims

* Demonstrate clean and well commented code
* Create a way to use **quadrant time management** that is easy to
  manage and does not require thousands of pieces of paper
* Provide myself with experience in managing my own projects

## Project State

QUAD is currently deemed as working but non-functional in terms of
achieving its aims. At present I am busy building the GUI elements and
will later move onto functionality. **It may be a while before an easy to
install and run version is released officially.**

Therefore, I encourage feedback on my project and any contributions are
welcome but attempting to run QUAD currently is not recommended.

## Features to add
* Keyboard shortcuts for saving and opening quadrant states
* Auto-save and loading of quadrant states
* Cleaner GUI (reduced window size)

## Thank you for checking out QUAD!

Please keep in mind that this is a part-time project and feedback may not be addressed in an immediate fashion
