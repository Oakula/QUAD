# QUAD

## QUAD is a productivity app written in Java that takes the methodology behind Stephen R. Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective People' and allows the user to organise their day/week in a small, lightweight app.

QUAD is fully open source and I welcome any feedback and contributions but please keep in mind that this is a part-time project and feedback may not be addressed in an immediate fashion
